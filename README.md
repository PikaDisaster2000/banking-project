Version 2.1 is the Latest version of this project.

How to use this program:
Open dataBank.csv. This csv is important in order to obtain the following information:
- Account number (including customer ID)
- Account Type (this is important for following policies in the bank)
- Name
- Address

After opening dataBank.csv open the BlueJ package attached (you may have to download this as a .ZIP file; please extract the files and ensure you open the latest version which is 2.1).

After opening said BlueJ Package right click on the class (box looking thing) called "RunProgram". It will show multiple options; click the option "void main(String[] args)" DO NOT click any other option.
The program will start up. Follow onscreen instructions (mainly using your keyboard).

Have fun :)

Troubleshooting:

When depositing or withdrawing the program may ask for a "Customer ID". This is a seven digit number that is in your bank account number (xx-xxxx-customerID-xx).
examples of customer IDs:
full account number:
08-0104-0476665-00

0476665 is the customer ID.

When asked for branch, you can type any integer because branchs are based on different locations (I could've made a list of branches but seriously? whos going to do that? I for sure am not doing that..)
